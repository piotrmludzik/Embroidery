# Embroidery


## Description
A simple application, written in Python, embroidered patterns in nice way on the console. The characters used for
embroidery can be defined. In addition, the task is primarily an exercise of algorithms, which avoids the repetition
of the code.

The application was created as a task at [CodeCool](https://codecool.com/en/) school. A description of the task
can be found here: [Exercise](https://github.com/piotrmludzik/Embroidery/wiki/Exercise).
